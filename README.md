# ITAcademy-8-Star-Wars
Users can signup and then signin in order to access informational cards about Star Wars movies, which are fetched from the APIs from https://swapi.dev/ and https://starwars-visualguide.com/#/. It is a static site: the authentication process is done with localstorage, not a real backend.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.5.
This project was deployed with Github Pages.

## Background
Result of the Sprint 8 at IT Academy.

## Stack
Angular, SASS - Bootstrap

## Usage
Log in to access the star wars list, then click "Press to start".
Sign up if you haven't already. You will be instantly logged in and redirected to the list of Star Wars starships.
Once you have access to the starships list, you can scroll to load more starships. Pick (click) one. A card will be displayed with detailed information (image, model, class, manufacturer...). Often some data is missing (this comes from the mentioned API's).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
